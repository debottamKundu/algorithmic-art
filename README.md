### Algorithimic-art generator

- Inspired by the excellent [Danielle Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2024-12-23_art-from-code-6/)
- Mostly a python port of the same concept, but also playing around with using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to set up everything.
- TO-DO:
  - Truchet tiles
  - Mosaic
